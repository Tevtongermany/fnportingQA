Go where Fortnite porting add-on is at (it is in [#‚Å†download](https://discord.gg/DZ5YFXdBA6)) Look for the download button and click on it. Once you have downloaded the zip file, you need to extract its contents. To do this, right-click on the zip file and select "**Extract All**". Choose a location on your computer where you want to extract the files. For example, you can create a new folder on your D: drive called "**porting**" and extract the files there. Open Blender on your computer. You can find Blender in the start menu or by searching for it in the search bar. In Blender, go to "**Edit**" in the top-left corner of the screen and click on "**Preferences**". In the Preferences window, select the "**Add-ons**" tab on the left-hand side of the screen. At the top of the Add-ons tab, click on the "**Install**" button. A file browser window will appear. Navigate to the location where you extracted the "BlenderFortnitePorting" zip file. In example, it should be in the "**D:/porting**" folder. Select the "**BlenderFortnitePorting.zip**" file and click on "**Install Add-on**". The add-on will be installed, and you should see a confirmation message at the top of the screen. Click on "**Save Preferences**" to save the changes. Finally, restart Blender to ensure that the add-on is properly loaded.
