Download the fortnite porting addon (from the discord channel [#‚Å†download](https://discord.gg/DZ5YFXdBA6)). Simply extract its contents to a location on your computer. In Blender, go to "**Edit**" in the top-left corner of the screen and click on "**Preferences**". In the Preferences window, select the "**Add-ons**" tab on the left-hand side. At the top of the Add-ons tab, click on the "**Install**" button. A file browser window will appear. Navigate to the location where you extracted the "BlenderFortnitePorting" zip file. Select the "**BlenderFortnitePorting.zip**" file and click on "**Install Add-on**". The add-on will be installed, and you should see a confirmation message at the top of the screen. Click on "**Save Preferences**" to save the changes. Finally, restart Blender to ensure that the add-on is properly loaded.   

## 5. to run this application, you must install missing frameworks for .NET.
Install this [.NET 6 Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.19-windows-x64-installer)  

## 6. Unable to load DLL "oo2core_9_win64.dll"
Install this [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

## 7. all Imported skins are gray
This might be caused by blender being set to 'Solid Mode', which does not render textures. Simply change the mode to either 'Material preview' or 'rendered view' to see textures.
This can be done either by pressing Z or clicking on the right icon as shown in the image below
